# Things I dont' know as of 2018

## Some of these topics in the list are learnt and forgotten

Programming Languages: I know and can use C#, Java and JavaScript effectively. I also am familiar with the memory management basics. I don't write multithreaded code yet as my experience in that is limited.

Web frameworks: I have used MERN stack and ASP.NET MVC stack and am comfortable with them. I haven't used Java based web frameworks like Spring Boot. I also haven't used Django.

Data Structures: I can solve arrays, strings, stacks, queues. Although I do get fuzzy frequently on trees, graphs and DP problems.

OOPS: I understand creational design patterns really well and have extensively read on this topic. But practice makes perfect and I lack practice.

Databases: I am familar with the SQL syntax but can get bogged up with different syntaxes since I have worked with MySQL, SQLServer and Oracle. I understand the tradeoff between relational and non-realational databases. I know and understand how data is actually stored but am not an expert in query or database optimizations although I can recognize when joins are not optimized.

Distributed Computing: I have an understanding of map-reduce,load balancing, service oriented architectures and other core concepts. I need to brush up on what is distributed caching and how does it work.

Operating Systems: I am familiar with processes, threads but don't write multithreaded code yet.

Internet topics: My favorite topic and I have a firm understanding of how the internet works and this flows nicely with my expertise in web apps.

Low-level languages: I have written some assembly in college but haven't visited that topic in years and have no immediate plans to do so. I have written both C and C++ and can understand pointer riddled code but haven't used them in years.

Networking stack: I understand DNS and virtual networks. I also know how TCP/IP operates and how low-level protocols work but haven't invested much time working with them and am somewhat fuzzy on some details.

Containers: I have used and deployed using Docker and am aware of the benefits. I haven't used Kubernetes but plan to use them in the future.

Serverless: I understand serverless applications but again haven't invested time in this.

Microservices: I understand the motivations and the drawbacks of using microservices but again haven't invested time here.

Python: I have created simple CRUD APIs with Python and have also used it for ML programs but haven't bothered to learn it in detail.

Node backends: I have created and worked on node backends and appreciate the flexibility and ease of setting up a project.

Native platforms: I haven't ever worked with Swift or Android. I have no immediate plans to do so either.

Algorithms: I have invested some time learning algorithms but can only recall mergesort and bubblesort from memory. I know tree traversals but always seem to forget how to solve DP or divide and conquer type problems.

Functional languages: Unless JavaScript is counted, I am unfamiliar with functional programming.

Modern CSS: I know and can use flexbox but don't know Grid but am planning to learn. I use Bootstrap examples to solve most of my design issues. If not I can float and position objects roughly on the screen to get my way.

CORS: I am familiar with CORS related issues having wasted hours on them.

HTTPS/SSL: I understand the concept and know how to set it up by configurations. I know the theory but don't really know what goes under the hood.

GraphQL: I know the concept having seen Facebookm API but haven't learnt it yet. It is one of the priority items I need to understand this year.

Sockets: I know the theory of how they work but haven't used them and hence don't understand it completely yet.

Electon: I have never tried it.

TypeScript: I understand the use of this and have been using them in React projects.

Deployment and DevOps: I can send files over FTP or kill processes but that is all I have done till now.

Graphics: I have used charting libraries before. I know canvas, SVG but can only copy paste in that domain for now.

Security: I am familiar with OWASP Top Security risks.
